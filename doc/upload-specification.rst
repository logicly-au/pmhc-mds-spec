.. _upload_specification:

Upload specification
====================

Files can be uploaded to the PMHC MDS manually via the web interface at https://pmhc-mds.net/ or
by using the API which is available at https://api.pmhc-mds.net/.

.. _file-requirements:

File requirements
-----------------
Uploads will be rejected by our incoming data scanning system if they do not
meet the following requirements:

* Must be either an :ref:`Excel Workbook (.xlsx) <excel-workbook>`,
* OR a :ref:`zip (.zip) file containing CSV files <csv-zip>`,
* AND must be :ref:`less than 512MB <file-size>`

.. _excel-workbook:

Excel Workbook (XLSX)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Excel files must be in XLSX format. Excel 2007 (v12.0) and above support this
file format.

One XLSX file must be uploaded containing multiple worksheets - one worksheet
for each format described :ref:`below <files-to-upload>`.

When saving your file, please choose the filetype 'Excel Workbook (.xlsx)'.

The filename of the Excel file doesn't matter as long as it has the file
extension .xlsx

.. _csv-zip:

Zip file containing Comma Separated Values (CSV)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The CSV files must conform to `RFC 4180 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt>`__.

In addition, CSV files must be created using UTF-8 character encoding.

CSV files must have the file extension .csv

Multiple CSV files must be uploaded - one CSV file for each format described
:ref:`below <files-to-upload>`.

The CSV files must be compressed into a single file by zipping before upload. The
filename of the zip file doesn't matter as long as it has the file
extension .zip

.. _file-size:

File size
^^^^^^^^^
Files must be less than 512MB. The file size restriction prevents our systems
from becoming unstable if extremely large files are uploaded. We will monitor
if this limit causes issues for anyone and adjust it if necessary.

.. _files-to-upload:

Files or worksheets to upload
-----------------------------

Version 4 allows for different files/worksheets to be uploaded depending on
whether the organisation is an Intake team, Treatment Service Provider or
a combined Intake/Treatment Service Provider. Please refer to
:ref:`introduction-contexts` for further information about these contexts.

All files must be internally consistent. An example of what this means
is that for every HeadtoHelp episode, service contact and measures in an upload file,
there must be a corresponding episode in the episodes file/worksheet.
It also means that for every row in the episodes file/worksheet, there must be a
corresponding client in the clients file/worksheet.

File format

Requirements for file formats:

- The first row must contain the column headings as defined for each file type.

- All files must be internally consistent. An example of what this means is

.. _deleting-records:

Deleting records
----------------

All records except for Organisation records  can be deleted via upload.
Please email support@pmhc-mds.com if you need to delete an organisation.

* An extra optional "delete" column can be added to each of the supported
  upload files/worksheets.

* If included, this column must be the third column in each file, after the organisation
  path and the record's entity key.

* To delete a record, include its organisation path and its entity key, leave
  all other fields blank and put "delete" in the "delete" column. Please note
  that case is important. "DELETE" will not be accepted.

* Marking a record as deleted will require all child records of that record also
  to be marked for deletion. For example, marking a client as deleted will
  require all episodes, service contacts and collection occasions of that
  client to be marked for deletion.

* While deletions can be included in the same upload as insertions/updates,
  we recommend that you include all deletions in a separate upload that is
  uploaded before the insertions/updates.

Example files showing how to delete via upload:

- `XLSX file containing all the worksheets <_static/example-files/PMHC-4-0-combined-delete.xlsx>`_.
- `CSV zip containing all the csv files  <_static/example-files/PMHC-4-0-combined-delete.zip>`_.

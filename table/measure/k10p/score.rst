The K10 Total score is based on the sum of K10 item 01 through 10 (range: 10-50).
Items 11 through 14 are excluded from the total because they are separate
measures of disability associated with the problems referred to in the preceding
ten items.

The Total score is computed as the sum of the scores for items 1 to 10. If any
item has not been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it is
excluded from the total

When items 01 through 10 has one item "not stated/missing" (value 9), the Total
Score is pro-rated using the following formula:

   Total score = round( sum of valid item scores / 9 * 10 )

When items 01 through 10 has more than one item "not stated/missing" (value 9),
the Total Score is set as invalid. Where this is the case, the "not stated/missing"
(value 99) should be used.

For more information on scoring the K10+, please refer to page 58 of AMHOCN’s

When upload report individual item scores and use a Total Score
‘99 - Not stated / Missing’, the PMHC MDS will calculate the total score.
